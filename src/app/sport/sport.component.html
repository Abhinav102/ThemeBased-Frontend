    <h2 class="man"> Lets have a quick look at the basics of cricket <br><br>Batting:</h2>
    <ul class="content">
          <li>
            Frontfoot Defence: Move the front foot as close as possible to the pitch of the ball along with the left shoulder
            and left elbow (for a right-handed batsman)moving the body in the direction of the ball.
          </li>
          <li>
            Backfoot Defence: Transfer your weight from your front foot on to your back foot to allow you to get deeper in the crease.
            Which ultimately will give you more time to play the shot. Even though you are back in the crease, ensure that the head stays forward into the shot.
          </li>
          <li>
            Straight Drive: Your Front foot should be going towards the pitch where the ball is bouncing and do not place your foot too much across 
            which may lead to LBW.The bat  face should be facing directly back towards the bowler. While striking the ball, maintain a high 
            front elbow.This allows the bat face to be as straight as possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover Drive:This shot is very similar to the straight drive, the only real difference is the direction in which it is played.
            This time, the ball will be hit through the ‘covers’ (hence the name ‘cover drive’).This shot is played to deliveries of a good 
            to full length that are on an off-stump line or wider.
          </li>
          <li>
            On Drive:This is another drive shot that Is played in a slightly different direction to the first two! This shot is played 
            through the leg side, towards the mid-on and long-on fielding positions. This shot is played to deliveries of a good to full 
            length that are on an leg-stump line or just sliding on to the pads.
          </li>
          <li>
            Square Drive:One of the risky drives in the list.This shot is played towards off-side more squarer than the cover 
            region to the deliveries that are good to full that are wide of off-stump.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Sweep Shot:One of the pre-meditated shots.During the sweep shot you should take a large stride down the pitch using front foot.
            The stride should be a comfortable length, not large enough that it ruins your balance.The large stride helps you to smother the 
            spin generated by the bowler, and may even mean that you can hit the ball on the full without having to judge the bounce.
            There is a big chance of getting LBW if you are not concentrating on the ball properly.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Reverse Sweep:The reverse sweep is another innovative front foot shot that has become incredibly popular in modern cricket.
            All you need to know about the shot is in the name! It is simply the ‘reverse’ of the normal sweep…and as such it is usually hit 
            behind square on the offside.This shot is played oftenly against spin in full to good length areas irrespective of the line.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Square Cut:The square cut is one of the most frequently used scoring shots in cricket, and it can be incredibly useful
            for punishing bowlers that have bowled a bad delivery. It is played square of the wicket on the off-side, and if you watch
            cricket regularly, you’ll see a lot of boundaries being scored with this shot.The shot is played to back of a length or 
            short deliveries that are wide of the off stump.
          </li> 
          <li>   
            The Pull Shot:The pull shot is another one of a batsman’s most deadly weapons. The shot can be hit in a variety of areas 
            on the leg side, ranging from mid-wicket to fine leg. This shot is usually played to back of a length balls that are 
            either in line with the stumps, or on the batsman’s body.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Hook Shot:The hook shot is also a shot that targets the leg side anywhere from mid-wicket to fine leg.This shot is
            incredibly similar to the pull shot in that it is usually played against fast bowlers who are bowling back of a length 
            or short pitched deliveries that are on the line of the stumps or the batsman’s body. The difference between hook and 
            the pull is that the hook shot is played to the deliveries that are over shoulder height. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The Leg Lance:The leg glance is an incredibly useful front foot shot. It’s incredibly effective when looking to put a 
            bad ball away,or steal a quick single. The front foot leg glance can be hit in various areas on the leg side, and this
            usually depends on how early or late we hit the ball.This shot can be played to any delivery towards middle and 
            leg-stump in mid-on to square-leg region.
          </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="man"> <br>Bowling:</h2>
    <ul class="content">
          <li>
            Pace Bowling:Fast bowlers, with their main focus on pace, through seam or swing, try deviating the ball.
            On the other hand, slow bowlers will divert the batsmen with an array of spin and flight.
          </li>
          <li>
            The understanding of the distinction between the terms fast-medium, medium-fast, and medium is very narrow.
            The deliveries bowled by fast bowlers vary from the bouncer, inswinger, leg cutter, off-cutter, outswinger,
            slower ball, Yorker to knuckleball. The techniques that influence pace bowling include grip, wrist position,
            action, run-up, follow-through, line, and length.The best way for a fast bowler is to bowl in a different 
            line and length which makes it difficult for the batsman to decide whether to attack, defend or leave.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spin Bowling:Spin bowlers are more useful in the later part of a game. This is because during the course
            of the game the ball gets old and worn out which could have more grip on the pitch. The pitch begins to 
            dry and crack as the game progresses. This, in turn, acts in favour of the bowling team. Wrist spin and
            finger spin are the two types of spin bowling in cricket.<br>In wrist spin, as the name already suggests,
            the bowlers use their wrist to impart spin to the ball. They release the ball from the back of their hand
            and so it passes over their little finger.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right-handed finger spin is called off-spin.
            Left-handed finger spin has no official name. 
            However, it is known as slow left-arm orthodox spin.
          </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="man"> <br>Fielding:</h2>
    <ul class="content">
            <li>
            Anyone who wants to play cricket must take fielding very seriously and every cricketer should 
            treat it as one of the main department of cricket, like batting and bowling.One should
            learn the correct way of stopping the ball, taking a catch in a safe way and then the art of picking 
            up and throwing.
            </li>  
            <li>
            Catches Win Matches!<br>
            A run saved is a run scored.Many matches have turned the other way because of one brilliant catch or a run out.
            It complements bowling and batting.Runs saved means more pressure on the batting side, and more chances for 
            bowlers to get them out quickly.
